![Final Map](/final.jpeg "Final version of Map")

I created this for my nephew Alex as a gift.  I found the original image as a super low resolution jpeg but the overall quality was so poor that I ended up re-drawing the entire thing.  It took about 8 hours total to make it 'perfect' and I am very happy with the result.

Posting it here so that others can use it for their projects.  

I laser cut this into 0.75" poplar wood using a FullSpectrum 45 watte laser cutter.  500x500 dpi, Speed: 25, Power: 100.  

Use inkscape (or equivalent) to view/modify.
